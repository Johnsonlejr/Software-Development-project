--ITERATION ONE README--

For this iteration we do not have an interfce implemented.

In order for us to test our classes, and for you to check our progress we have created a test called IterationOneTest.
We have also included a skeleton version called EmptyIterationOneTest that you can add your own paramaters to if you
want to tests things out yourself.

Please see the UML diagram for information on methods and parameters.

A general outline for our test is as follows:
- create a student
- create a course
- add the course to the student
- create catagories of assignments
- add the catagories to the course
- create assignments
- add the assignments to the catagories
- calculate the grade for the course
- calculate the GPA for the student
- print everything out
